  Scooter sharing made simple

  Scoot takes the hassle out of urban mobility. Our bikes are placed in convenient 
  locations in each of our cities. Use our app to locate the nearest bike, unlock 
  it with a tap, and you’re away!

  Get Scootin



  Locate with app

  Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously placing scooters 
  in the areas with most demand, so one should never be too far away. 

  Pick your scooter

  We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So you know how much 
  charge they have left and can see roughly how much it will cost.

  Enjoy the ride

  Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put on a helmet, 
  and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and accessibility ramps.



  Easy to use riding telemetry

  The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it can show you your 
  average speed, how long you've been using the scooter, your traveling distance, 
  and many more things all in an easy to use app.

  Coming to a city near you

  Scoot is available in 4 major cities so far. We’re expanding rapidly, so be sure 
  to let us know if you want to see us in your hometown. We’re aiming to let our 
  scooters loose on 23 cities over the coming year.

  Zero hassle payments

  Our payment is as easy as one two three. We accept most credit cards and debit cards. 
  You can also link your PayPal account inside the app. Need to pay later? No worries!
